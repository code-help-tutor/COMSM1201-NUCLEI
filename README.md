The programming language LISP, developed in 1958, is one of the oldest languages still in common use. The langauage is famous for: being fully parenthesised (that is, every instruction is inside its own brackets), having a prefix notation (e.g. functions are written (PLUS 1 2) and not (1 PLUS 2)) and its efficent linked-list Car/Cdr structure for (de-)composing lists.
Here, we develop a very simple langauge inspired by these concepts called NUCLEI (Neill’s UnCommon Lisp Expression Interpreter) and a means to parse or interpret the instructions.
The interpreter (but not parser) builds on Exercise 11.4 - you’ll need to have your own version of the linked.c, lisp.h and specific.h files.
